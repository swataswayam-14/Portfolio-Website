    description:
      "In this project, key features include enhanced farmer income by 20% through direct sales, bypassing middlemen, and efficient management of crop listings and harvest details. Additionally, the platform enables decreased food waste by allowing farmers to adjust harvests using real-time market data, potentially reducing crop waste by 15-20%. Moreover, the system promotes fair pricing by providing vegetable shop owners and consumers access to farmer profiles by location and harvest, ensuring competitive prices for fresh produce sourced directly from farmers. Lastly, farmers can extend their market reach by 30% through expanding beyond local markets, leveraging the platform's reach for growth. These features collectively contribute to empowering farmers, reducing waste, ensuring fair pricing, and expanding market opportunities.",
